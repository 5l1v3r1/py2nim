# py2nim

A WIP tool for porting Python code to Nim

Based on [languist](https://github.com/metacraft-labs/languist)

## how to use

```bash
./py2nim <filename>.py
```

generates `<filename>.nim`

translating projects is WIP, but it would use

```bash
./py2nim <project>
```

and the `languist.json` file there
